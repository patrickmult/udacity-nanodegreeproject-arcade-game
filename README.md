# udacity-nanodegreeproject-arcade-game
This is a clone of the classic Frogger arcade game coded in Javascript as a project for the Udacity Front End Developer courses. Used the psuedo classical pattern.

To run: Clone the repo and open frogger.html. Use they keyboard arrow keys for movement.
        OR go to www.cactusworks.net/apps/frogger.html

Scoreboard resets on death but tracks highschores, and the difficulty ramps each time you get a point. Good luck!

To-Do: Add some music & sound effects.
